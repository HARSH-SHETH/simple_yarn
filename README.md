# Let's Dev: A Package Manager

> This project has been created to showcase the [article of the same name ](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/07/11/lets-dev-a-package-manager/). It is not an alternate package manager, and we do not plan to support it in the future.

## Installation

```
$> git clone git@github.com:yarnpkg/lets-dev-demo
$> cd lets-dev-demo
$> yarn
```

## Usage

```
babel-node index.js [package.json parent directory] [node_modules parent directory]
```

- If missing, the `package.json` parent directory will default to `.`
- If missing, the `node_modules` parent directory will default to the `package.json` parent directory

## Demo

For demo sake, the following command can be used:

```
$> yarn install-self
```

The demo will then install its own dependencies inside a temporary `node_modules` folder, then delete the old one, then move the new one in its final location. You can execute this command as much time as you want: the demo is able to install itself flawlessly!
